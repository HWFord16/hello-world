# hello-world

Hey There! 

Making my way through this Hello World guide to learn and understand navigating my way around Github. 
Understanding repositories, branches, commits and pull requests. 

I am still a novice to programming as I've mainly been scripting in python for work puporses. 
Creating automated process that make manual procedures more efficient such as Cisco codec provisioning,
setting configurations, checking codec status and Ipv6 Genereations & discovery(ping) from MAC addresses.

Looking forward to getting more accquainted and proficient with GitHub's workflow to propel my programming 
experince & journey. 

Thanks for reading!
